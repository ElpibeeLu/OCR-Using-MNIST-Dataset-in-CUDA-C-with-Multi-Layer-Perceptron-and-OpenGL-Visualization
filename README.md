# OCR-Using-MNIST-Dataset-in-CUDA-C-with-Multi-Layer-Perceptron-and-OpenGL-Visualization
This repository contains an OCR system for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset, implemented in CUDA C++ with a multi-layer perceptron neural network. The project also includes an OpenGL-based visualization tool to observe the training process in real-time.
